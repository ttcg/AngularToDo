# AngularToDo
Angular ToDo Project by using Arrays

When I first started learning Angular 2 in VS2015 (Around Oct 2016), there weren't many tutorials about integration VS2015 and ng2.  Since my main background is C#.Net, I prefer to use VS2015 rather than other IDEs.  

During the learning phase of ng2, I did struggle with the new ecosystems and terms such as node_modules, gulp, npm, systemjs, webpacks, etc.  I was completely overwhelmed by these terms and didn't know where to start and what to learn.  Kept watching videos and reading tutorials to try to understand these.  The problem is that there are so many ways to develop and compile ng2 and there is no simple way as I did in c# or .Net core.

Somes use systemjs, somes use webpacks, somes use Angular2CLI to compile and start, somes use Gulps to monitor and transfer files, somes use tsconfig.ts to compile, etc and I was completely lost in these multiple ways to achieve the same goal and couldn't decide which way is the best to follow.  Since there is no standard official template from Microsoft to develop a ng2 app in VS2015, it was quite a huge learning curve for me to pick up this technology.

So, I decided to create the real simple app in VS2015, rather than multiple 'hello world' ng2 app tutorials available on the Internet.

This project will contain all basic CRUD activities for todo items by using in-memory array list of Todo Objects.

Hope it helps you in learning ng2 in VS2015.
